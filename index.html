								<p>Hi, I'm a Brazilian student who is currently graduated in IT and pursuing another one in Computational Engineering.</p>
								<p>I have a great passion for technology and a keen interest in Cybersecurity, my mission is to become a leading expert in the field. With a wealth of knowledge and experience. But you can know more about me acessing <a href="#about">ABOUT</a> panel.</p>

								<p>As a passionate software developer, I have been working on several projects that showcase my skills and creativity.</p>
								<p>One of my most recent projects involved creating a bot to automate the access of university students on Discord using Python. This bot was designed to make it easier for students to join the relevant university channels on Discord without having to navigate through multiple menus. It was a challenging project, but I learned a lot about Python and automation techniques using Pandas.</p>
								<p>Another project I am particularly proud of is the creation of a full 3D world in a website using JavaScript. It allowed me to showcase my skills in web development and graphic design. The website was designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, and it was well-received by my peers.</p>
								<p>I am also one of the creators of an algorithm that attempts to predict Parkinson's disease. This was a particularly meaningful project for me, as it involved using my programming skills to help solve a real-world problem. I was able to collaborate with other experts in the field, and I am proud of the impact that our algorithm could have on diagnosing Parkinson's disease.</p>
								<p>In addition to these projects, I also manage online groups with almost 6000 people. This involves coordinating events and activities and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.</p>
								<p>Finally, I also enjoy editing photos and videos using Adobe programs. This is a passion of mine, and it allows me to express my creativity in a different way. I take pride in the work that I do, and I am always looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills.</p>

								<p>Hi, I'm Iago, a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology and a keen interest in Cybersecurity and Pentesting. With a degree in IT and a wealth of experience in the field, I'm well-equipped to tackle any technological challenge that comes my way.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am a researcher at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cilab.ufersa/">CILab</a>, where we are exploring innovative ways to predict Parkinson's Disease using Python and AI. Our work in this field demonstrates my expertise in data analysis and programming, which they also bring to bear in their Cybersecurity and Pentesting pursuits, dont you think? ðŸ‘€.</p>
								<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, I have a deep understanding of the various threats that exist in the digital landscape, and is always seeking out new strategies and techniques to stay ahead of the curve. Through my expertise in pentesting, I'm able to identify vulnerabilities in systems and develop effective solutions to address them.</p>
								<p>Overall, I try to be a highly talented individual who is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of technology. Whether they are developing AI models to predict Parkinson's Disease or exploring the latest cybersecurity strategies and techniques, trying to always look for new and innovative ways to make a positive impact in the field.</p>
